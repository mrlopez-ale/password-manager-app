Documentation for Local Password Manager


This document provides a description of the Python code for a local password manager application. The application allows users to generate strong passwords and securely store them on their local machine using AES-256 encryption. It features a basic Graphical User Interface (GUI) built with Tkinter.
Overview
The password manager encrypts and stores website-password pairs in a local file (passwords.dat). The encryption key is derived from a master password provided by the user, using the PBKDF2HMAC key derivation function with a salt. The application provides functionalities to:
Generate strong, customizable passwords.
Add new website-password entries to the encrypted storage.
Retrieve passwords for specific websites.
The GUI provides a user-friendly way to interact with these functionalities.
