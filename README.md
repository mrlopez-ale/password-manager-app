Documentation for Local Password Manager


This document describes a Python-based local password manager. The application uses AES-256 encryption to securely store website-password pairs in a local file.  A Tkinter-based GUI allows users to generate strong passwords, add new entries, and retrieve stored passwords.  The encryption key is derived from a user-provided master password using PBKDF2HMAC.
